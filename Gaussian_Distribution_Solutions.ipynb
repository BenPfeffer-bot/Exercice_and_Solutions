    "A Gaussian distribution, also known as a normal distribution, is characterized by two primary parameters:\n",

    "- **Mean (`μ`)**: This parameter represents the center or the average value around which the data points are distributed. It determines the peak of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation (`σ`)**: This parameter measures the spread or dispersion of the data points around the mean. A smaller standard deviation indicates that the data points are closely clustered around the mean, while a larger standard deviation implies that the data points are spread out over a wider range.\n",
